# Goweb 2

  * BETA is ready to use

## Get started

  * Clone the goweb `v2` branch into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/stretchrcom`
  * Import the package as usual with `import "github.com/stretchrcom/goweb"` in your code
  * Open the docs locally by navigating to your `$GOPATH` folder and doing `godoc -http=:6060` in Terminal, then visit `http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/stretchrcom/goweb/`
  * Look at the `example_webapp` project for some ideas of how to get going
