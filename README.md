goweb
=====

A lightweight RESTful web framework for Go

We plan on rewriting goweb using the knowledge gained from writing Stretchr. This will happen soon, hopefully. In the meantime, feel free to use goweb as-is! It's completely functional!

A proper README will be forthcoming. :)

  * UPDATE: v2 has started, want to help us?  https://github.com/stretchrcom/goweb/tree/v2
